React is just amazing and the new update of _Hooks_ is just awesome. I have been using reactJS for almost 3 three years now.
And I really love it. I has made my life so much easier than before. I don't need to traverse the DOM Manually to update anything in the page.
Just Change the data and it reflects inside the DOM just like a magic.

> ReactJS is an awesome library for frontend.
